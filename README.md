## üìã Description

This air quality monitoring tool is a Next.js-based web application that provides real-time air quality data visualization through interactive maps. The system integrates multiple air quality data sources including AQICN, IQAir, OpenSense, OpenAQ, and OpenWeather APIs to provide comprehensive air quality monitoring capabilities.

The application features an interactive map interface powered by Mapbox GL JS, allowing users to visualize air quality data through various visualization methods including circles, 3D extrusions, and heatmaps. Users can compare data from different sources, filter by pollutants, and analyze historical trends.

### Visualization Capabilities

The Air Quality Monitoring Tool successfully integrates data from various sources and presents it in an interactive web application. Users can select any source to view current air quality information around the world. For each source, the application presents visuals, external factors and pollutant querying.

**Data-Driven Visualizations:**

- **Circle Overlays**: Color-coded circles reflect pollutant levels using defined boundaries to indicate severity
- **3D Extrusions**: Enhanced visualization with extrusion length indicating levels, offering a more immersive understanding while ensuring clarity even with extruded buildings
- **Heatmaps**: Aggregated view of air quality where darker hotspots indicate more sensors and higher levels, smoothing individual sensor readings into a gradient that signifies trends

### User Experience & Design

The tool design was met with great positivity, featuring a dark-themed interface where every text and component is placed delicately, considering clarity and distinction. The implementation ensures optimal user experience with smooth interactions and intuitive navigation.
